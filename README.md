In essence, 

* We compute 8 key technical indicators to inform our two machine learning models. One is a Ridge regression, used to forecast monthly returns. The other is a Random Forest, used to predict upward movement probabilities.
  
* These predictions are then converted into z-scores used to rank individual assets. Assets with a higher probability of moving upwards will have a higher z-score rank, and thus a larger allocation.
  
* The final weights are adjusted based on the prevailing macroeconomic regime, which are identified through K-means clustering. Each regime is associated with a fixed asset class allocation.
